Here using oftware Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model.
=SDLC is a systematic process for building software that ensures the quality and correctness of the software built. SDLC process aims to produce high-quality software that meets customer expectations.
SDLC Phase:

    Phase 1: Requirement collection and analysis
    Phase 2: Feasibility study
    Phase 3: Design
    Phase 4: Coding
    Phase 5: Testing
    Phase 6: Installation/Deployment
    Phase 7: Maintenance
Phase 1: Requirement collection and analysis
=The requirement is the first stage in the SDLC process. It is conducted by the senior team members with inputs from all the stakeholders and domain experts in the industry. Planning for the quality assurance requirements and recognization of the risks involved is also done at this stage.
Phase 2: Feasibility study
=This process conducted with the help of ‘Software Requirement Specification’ document also known as ‘SRS’ document. It includes everything which should be designed and developed during the project life cycle.
Phase 3: Design
=In this third phase, the system and software design documents are prepared as per the requirement specification document. This helps define overall system architecture.
Phase 4: Coding
=In this phase, Developer needs to follow certain predefined coding guidelines. They also need to use programming tools like compiler, interpreters, debugger to generate and implement the code.
Phase 5: Testing
=QA and testing team may find some bugs/defects which they communicate to developers. The development team fixes the bug and send back to QA for a re-test. This process continues until the software is bug-free, stable, and working according to the business needs of that system.
Phase 6: Installation/Deployment
=Once the software testing phase is over and no bugs or errors left in the system then the final deployment process starts. 
Phase 7: Maintenance
=Once the system is deployed, and customers start using the developed system.
