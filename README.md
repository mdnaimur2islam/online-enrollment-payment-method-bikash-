### I used a software development process, the waterfall methodology has seven stages:

- ## 1.Requirements
   Potential requirements, deadlines and guidelines for the project are analyzed and placed into a formal requirements document, also called a functional specification. This stage of development defines and plans the project without mentioning specific processes.
## 2.Analysis
  The system specifications are analyzed to generate product models and business logic to guide production. This is also when financial and technical resources are audited for feasibility.
## 3. Design
  A design specification document is created to outline technical design requirements, such as the programming language, hardware, data sources, architecture and services.
## 4. Coding and implementation
  The source code is developed using the models, logic and requirement specifications designated in the prior phases. Typically, the system is coded in smaller components, or units, before being put together.
## 5. Testing
  This is when quality assurance, unit, system and beta tests identify issues that must be resolved. This may cause a forced repeat of the coding stage for debugging. If the system passes integration and testing, the waterfall continues forward.
## 6.Operation and deployment
  The product or application is deemed fully functional and is deployed to a live environment.
## 7.Maintenance
  Corrective, adaptive and perfective maintenance is carried out indefinitely to improve, update and enhance the product and its functionality. This could include releasing patch updates and new versions.



### First we see login page .
   ---after log in we see Homepage 
     ---ther are many Option such as 
     -NewStudent
     -PaymentInfo
     -TotalBill
     -EnrollmentInfo
     -Student Details
## Then every option has many option and form
   ### To Store Information Here used Database,MySQL
   ## Repeat And Regular Student has separate database for store Enrollment information
   
   ## after payment They receive pdf for Identity.
